# Images Directory

This directory contains all the static images used in the application.

└── illustrations/  # Illustration assets
```

## Usage Guidelines

1. Use descriptive names for images (e.g., `hero-banner.webp`, `login-background.jpg`)
2. Prefer modern formats like WebP for better performance
3. Include appropriate size variations for responsive design
4. Optimize images before committing
5. Keep original files in a separate source directory

## Image Optimization

Before adding images to this directory:
1. Compress images using tools like ImageOptim, TinyPNG, or Squoosh
2. Convert to WebP format when possible
3. Consider creating multiple sizes for responsive design
4. Keep image file sizes under 200KB when possible

## Naming Convention

Follow this naming pattern:
- `purpose-description-size.format`
- Example: `hero-banner-large.webp`
